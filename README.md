## Project Description
This project focuses on building a deep learning model using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the next word in a sequence of text. The model is trained on a dataset containing text from a file ("IndiaUS.txt"). The goal is to develop a language model that can understand context and generate meaningful next-word predictions.
