## Project Description
This project aims to classify individuals into age categories (YOUNG, MIDDLE, OLD) using a CNN based deep learning model. The dataset consists of images labeled with age categories, and the goal is to train a model to predict these categories accurately. The workflow includes data preprocessing, image loading, label encoding, dataset splitting, and preparation for model training.
